## Description

The system will keep a constant distance from the target. This is a prototype for a low cost linear follower. The challenge was becoming familiar with the labView interface and communicating with the electronics. 

#### Technologies

- Labview for UI and control design 
- National Instruments DAQ
- Noise reduction teqniues.
